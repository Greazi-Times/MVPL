#   MagicValley-Plugin configuration
#   Last updated on ${project.version}-b${buildNumber}
#
#   This file contains all the settings of the plugin features can be simpy disabled and enabled.
#
#   Why did I make a config file even tho it is a custom made plugin for MagicValley?
#   I have chosen to create a config file to enable and disable feature faster. If there is a
#   feature that causes to make the server performance worse, than it can be disabled with chaining a simple
#   value of the config.
#
#   Keep in mind most of the values need to be True or False.
#
#   Every feature has a detail explanation, possible values and a default value.
